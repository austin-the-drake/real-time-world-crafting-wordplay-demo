You will evaluate the generated spell script based on the following four axes. This is a challenging task and you should evaluate critically. "doing the best with what it could" does not deserve extra points; only consider how well the final result fulfils the task, even if there is no good solution possible. scores of 3 are "good, passable". Any mistakes should result in 1 or 2. Score each axis from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).

Creative Alignment (1-5):
(This scale measures how well the spell matched the core concept or "theme" of the user's description, with an emphasis on presentation.)

	1 (No Connection): The spell's core function was the opposite of what was requested.
	2 (Mostly Unrelated): The spell captured a minor keyword but missed the main theme entirely.
	3 (Got the Gist): The spell implemented the main verb or noun of the idea but missed all the creative nuance.
	4 (Good Match): The spell successfully captured the core concept and most of the important descriptive details, feeling very close to what was described.
	5 (Perfect Match): The spell perfectly captured the core concept and all thematic details, feeling exactly like what was imagined.

Instructional Precision (1-5):
(This scale measures how well the spell obeyed any specific, direct commands or constraints the user included, with an emphasis on logic.)

	1 (Ignored All Instructions): The spell failed to follow multiple explicit instructions.
	2 (Ignored Key Instructions): The spell followed minor instructions but ignored a critical, high-priority one.
	3 (Followed Most Instructions): The spell followed the main instructions but missed a less critical one or misinterpreted a numerical value significantly.
	4 (Followed All Instructions, Minor Flaw): The spell implemented every instruction, but with a tiny imprecision.
	5 (Followed All Instructions Perfectly): Every single explicit instruction and constraint was implemented precisely as requested.

Emergence (1-5):
(This scale measures if the spell's behaviour went above and beyond the user's request in a positive way.)

	1 (Boring): The spell was simpler than what was requested, resulting in an underwhelming surprise.
	2 (Literal): The spell was a completely literal and uninspired translation of the prompt with no creative flair whatsoever.
	3 (Competent but Unsurprising): The spell was a well-designed and functional implementation of the idea, but it did exactly what was asked and nothing more.
	4 (Clever Detail): The spell included a small, unrequested feature or detail that cleverly complemented and improved the core idea.
	5 (Delightful Surprise): The spell added a significant, unrequested feature that was a perfect creative fit, making the entire concept much better and more interesting.

Structural & Logical Coherence (1-5):
(This scale evaluates the syntactic and logical validity of the generated spell.)

Be on the lookout for elements appearing in the spell that aren't actually available for use, and apply a penalty if so.

This is informed by the "Algorithmic Pre-Check". If the pre-check failed, this score cannot be higher than 2.

	1: Invalid JSON or major structural errors (e.g., components is not a list).
	3: Valid JSON, but with some data type errors or logical conflicts forbidden by the rules (e.g., a manifestation component having a deathTrigger).
	5: The entire response is a single, valid JSON object with perfect data types and structure, and it is completely free of any logical contradictions defined in the component rules.
