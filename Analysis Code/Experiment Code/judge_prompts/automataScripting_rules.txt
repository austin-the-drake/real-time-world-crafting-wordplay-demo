Your primary role is to evaluate a JSON-based behavior script for a cellular automata simulation. You will act as a strict technical reviewer. This is a difficult logical and creative task, and most scripts will not achieve a perfect score. Being merely "correct" is the baseline for an average score of 3; higher scores require efficiency, deep contextual awareness, and creativity.

This prompt provides all the information you need in a structured format. First, you will be presented with the task rules, which detail the available node types and the required JSON structure (name, color_hex, behaviour). Following these rules, you will find the evaluation rubric to guide your scoring and the required output schema for your own response. Finally, you will see the full task, which includes the original user input (the behavioral concept), the context (existing elements in the simulation), the response to evaluate (the generated JSON script), and an algorithmic validation pre-check result.

Please begin by carefully reviewing the Task Rules below.

Available Node Types (for the actions array inside the behavior struct):

I. Wrapper / Modifier Nodes (These contain other nodes):
* { "type": "in_rand_rotation", "actions": [ ... ] }: Executes nested actions in one random of 8 directions.
* { "type": "in_rand_mirror", "actions": [ ... ] }: 50% chance to mirror nested actions across the vertical axis (east becomes west, etc.).
* { "type": "in_rand_flip", "actions": [ ... ] }: 50% chance to flip nested actions across the horizontal axis (north becomes south, etc.).

II. Conditional Nodes (These check a condition and then run nested actions):
* { "type": "if_neighbor_is", "direction": "...", "options": ["type1", "type2"], "actions": [ ... ], "else_actions": [ ... ] }: Checks if a neighbor is one of the types in options.
* { "type": "if_neighbor_is_not", "direction": "...", "options": ["type1"], "actions": [ ... ] }: The inverse of the above.
* { "type": "if_alpha", "target": "self|direction", "comparison": "...", "is": number, "actions": [ ... ] }: Checks a cell's alpha value. comparison options: "less_than", "greater_than", "equal_to", "not_equal_to".
* { "type": "if_neighbor_count", "direction_set": ["dir1", ...], "options": ["type1"], "comparison": "...", "count": number, "actions": [ ... ] }: Counts neighbors of a certain type in the given directions and compares the total.
* { "type": "if_chance", "percent": number (0-100), "actions": [ ... ] }: Succeeds based on a percentage chance.

III. Executor / Action Nodes (These perform an action and are usually the innermost nodes):
* { "type": "do_swap", "direction": "...", "actions": [ ... ] (optional) }: Swaps position with a neighbor, then can immediately run a nested actions list from the cell's new location. This entire operation ends the cell's turn.
* { "type": "do_set_type", "target": "self|direction", "to": "new_type" }: Changes a cell's type.
* { "type": "do_set_alpha", "target": "self|direction", "operation": "...", "to": number }: Modifies a cell's alpha value. operation options: "set", "add", "subtract".
* { "type": "do_spawn", "direction": "...", "into_options": ["air"], "set_type": "...", "set_alpha": number (optional) }: Creates a new particle in an adjacent cell if it's a valid type.
* { "type": "do_copy_alpha", "source_direction": "...", "dest_direction": "..." }: Copies the alpha value from one cell to another.
