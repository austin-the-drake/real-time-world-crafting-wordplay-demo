    "# Experiment Pipeline Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the main control panel for running a complete experiment from start to finish. It generates test data, gets responses from a model, evaluates those responses, and exports the results for analysis in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "The cells are designed to be run from top to bottom. Several cells expect user-set paths and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cells consist of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Environment Setup and Imports\n",
    "2.  (Optional) Full Reset\n",
    "3.  Generate Synthetic Task Data\n",
    "4.  Main Translation Task\n",
    "5.  Data Labelling\n",
    "6.  Ingest Session Logs into Database\n",
    "7.  Evaluation and LLM Judging\n",
    "8.  Final Results and Exporting\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies can be installed with the provided \"requirements.txt\", or via the following:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pandas apted google-genai anthropic openai ipykernel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook expects API keys to work with language models. The following environment variables must contain valid API keys, depending on the models used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"GEMINI_API_KEY\": Required for synthetic data generation or prompting Gemini models\n",
    "* \"OPENAI_API_KEY\": Required if prompting OpenAI models\n",
    "* \"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\": Required if prompting Anthropic models\n",
    "\n",
    "You can temporarily and easily set these environment variables from this notebook in the first code cell. Google offers free API keys at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey"
